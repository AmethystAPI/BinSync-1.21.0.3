Today I've just done some bugfixes relating to entrances.

I tested the game with peashooter and some of the networking works but the synched variable is not updating from other clients to the host. I've also switched to using the TCP transport because UDP port forwarding is a bit strange on my router.

While I wait for access to another device to test on I'm going to work on handling an actual game over and restarting the game. This should complete the full gameplay loop. I also want to try and make a simple menu UI so people don't have to use arbitrary key binds.

I've fixed the issue with synched variables not updating. Something with using ticks from the time class. Instead I just gave every packet an index and used that instead for the ordering.
