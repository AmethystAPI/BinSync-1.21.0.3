Today I started work on the project squad prototype. The goal here is to get something playable with the current design ideas out in about a week. I've made so much progress today, it's great. Right now the prototype is being developed without network rollback and instead with some updated client side prediction ideas, like an updated version of the last P.S. This has made development so much faster as well as allowing me to use C# without having to write a physics engine from scratch.

Update List:
- Auto multiplayer setup
- Simple player movement
- Spawning rooms
- Spawning enemies in rooms
- Sword weapon that shoots projectiles
- Attacking and killing enemies
