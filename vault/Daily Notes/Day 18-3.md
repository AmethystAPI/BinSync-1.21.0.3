Today was not as productive as yesterday. I encountered a bug in Godot's `MultiplayerSynchronizer` code that prevents me from continuing my work on item pickups. I was working on turning the item into the pickup instead of having an item pickup scene, but reparenting the items during this process breaks the synchronizer. I've submitted a bug report but intend to look into fixing it myself. I've narrowed down a part of the code where the issue is occurring but I don't know the source of the problem. I'll look into this more later.
