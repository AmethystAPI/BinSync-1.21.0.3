*2023-12-25* Christmas!

I attempted to fix the bug in Godot's `MultiplayerSynchronizer` but I couldn't understand the code fast enough with my limited understanding of C++. So, I decided to instead just move to using the networking library Riptide and it seems to be working great so far!

On top of riptide I've implemented a system that allows me to register nodes with Rpcs and Synched Variables without inheriting from a class, only an interface! I had some issues with the update speed of the network variable but it turned out I was just sending too many packets.

The pesky issue with equipping items has now been resolved using the new Riptide backend!
