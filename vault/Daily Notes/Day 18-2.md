Today was continuation of yesterday's prototype development. I should be able to finish the trinket system and the boss today. I also need to make some updates to how room edges are handled so that player's can't skip rooms. 

## What's Next
After this, a complete gameplay prototype will actually exist, although it will be incredibly work in progress. My plan is to continue the prototype to add some necessary polish like attack telegraphing and items drops saying what the have. I also will add some random generation and fix up player damage. With this, I'll probably need to make a state machine system so that It isn't an absolute pain to manage player state and slime state.

Changes:
- Hammer
- Loot spawning
- Big slime
- Fast slime
- New world generation system see [[Implementation/World Generation|World Generation]]
