# [r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming)
This is the biggest gaming subreddit with the most potential for capturing gamers. If you never post to [r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming), you are missing out on tens of thousands of potential sales.

**What** _**won't**_ **work:** blogs, self posts
**What** _**will**_ **work:** memes, interesting/awesome/clever game play gifs(Seriously consider posting memes as a legitimate, professional marketing strategy.)
# [r/games](https://www.reddit.com/r/games)
Very different audience than [r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming) -- these are the core gamers who are much more interested in discussing and discovering new games than the casuals. This is the most reliable place to post your blog, as long as it's something interesting and not just a devlog update.

**What** _**won't**_ **work:** memes, most self posts
**What** _**will**_ **work:** game announcements, in-depth analysis of a particular genre, game, or game mechanic (and of course mention your game in the comments).
# [r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev) 
You're not actually allowed to announce game updates and do regular marketing here -- plus, game devs are probably not your core audience anyway, so I wouldn't focus here too much.

**What** _**won't**_ **work:** memes, game announcements
**What** _**will**_ **work:** post-mortems, tutorials, motivational posts, anything that has to do with free assets (seriously you guys lose your minds over free assets)
# [r/indiegaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegaming) 
This is an EXTREMELY visual sub. If your game is visually appealing, you could make a gif of some cool new thing you added and post it there once a month.

**What** _**won't**_ **work:** low quality content (including memes), anything that requires reading
**What** _**will**_ **work:** videos/gifs/screenshots that show off something visually appealing
# [r/roguelikes](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes) 
Obviously, only post here if your game is a roguelike. This sub has a lot of interesting discussions about specific roguelikes and game mechanics. As you might expect, this is an extremely text-heavy sub -- almost all posts are self posts.

**What** _**won't**_ **work:** pissing off the hardcore roguelike fans by claiming your game is a roguelike when it's not
**What** _**will**_ **work:** tastefully promoting and discussing your game as a roguelite in a modestly self-deprecating way.
