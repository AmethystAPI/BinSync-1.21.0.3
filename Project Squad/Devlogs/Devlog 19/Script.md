Sometimes it just feels like no one cares. And it scares me. I'm scared that after the years of work, the countless hours poured into this creation I love so much, in the end no one will care.

I mean, I look out at all of the other's being so successful, and then I look back at myself, feeling like I'm getting nowhere. Maybe my game isn't good enough. I mean I must be doing something wrong. I have to...

No. This isn't right. I need to step back...

I didn't start making games because I wanted to be popular. I make games because I want to play with friends. 

And yet, If I'm ever going to keep doing this, I need people to care.

We'll do another post, why not. We'll do something different. Because it doesn't matter how many posts I make that no one sees. I only need one to work.

Yes! It worked. See, people do care. You just can't give up.
