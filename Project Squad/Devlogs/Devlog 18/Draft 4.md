## Intro
*Holds up "your game"* When the success on your game hinges on your prototype, *Tosses aside 
"your game", Flicks on switch and monitor Turns on* how do you know what to prototype, what to not, when to finish?

We're going *Looks to side and Cuts to where I'm looking* to learn three techniques *Three monitors with numbers Turn on* that the developers of Outer Wilds, Spelunky, and Spore use to make sure their prototype is successful. *the symbol of each game Replaces number as their are said*

## Technique #1: Outer Wilds
The first technique is to prototype the riskiest element first. This is usually a game mechanic but it can also be a storyline, and even an art style.

When Alex Beachum was developing the prototype for Outer Wilds, they specifically began by creating a paper prototype to test the narrative structure. If you haven't played Outer Wilds, what are you doing, it won best game, best design, and best narrative in 2020, but if you have you'll immediately recognize why they began by prototyping the story, and why people love it so much. The narrative sets the unique identify of the game and every other aspect, from the space flight to the quantum mechanics and time travel is designed around that narrative. 

"\[The paper prototype] completely abstracted away the space travel and focused on what we wanted to test: the underlying narrative structure. "

A shaky narrative would lead to a shaky game, so by cementing this first, they were able to create a master piece. They could have started by designing the visual style or prototyping the scout mechanics but that isn't the riskiest or most important part of the game. Really this is a time saving technique. Not only does it make it faster for player's to interact with the core mechanic, but it gets explored quicker.

"We needed a way for players to test the game's entire narrative structure in a fraction of the time it would take during a normal playthrough."

So, prototyping the core element of the game first, setup a stable foundation for further development and saved critical time. But, Derek Yu, the developer of Spelunky kind of did the opposite of this, but I'll get to that in a minute. Let's talk about how Chrisk Hecker, the developer of Spore handles prototyping.

## Technique #2: Spore
The second technique is to fail fast. This means that if a prototype isn't working out, don't be afraid to quickly abandon it. It is much faster to make a variety of different prototypes, landing on an idea that feels compelling and has been shown to be fun, than to spend a long time developing the idea in to a real game only to find out it was never a good idea in the first place. Chris Hecker, a developer of Spore talks his experience with not properly prototyping out ideas:

"The ambitious projects I had undertaken in the past *failed* because I made the mistake of not proving out the core ideas in prototypes."

Prototyping might feel like this huge daunting task now. You don't want to do it wrong because you don't want to waste time, and you don't want another abandoned project. Don't worry, even though there are a lot of techniques to make sure you make your prototypes worthwhile, in the end, just making something small is the most valuable thing you can do.

## Technique #3: Spelunky
Which brings us to our third and final technique used by Spelunky's creator, Derek Yu: Just make doodles. What Derek means is to make a tiny little experiment for fun. Don't overthink what you are designing or if you are wasting time with an idea. Sometimes, prototyping should just be a form of play. Derek strategy is to have fun with little ideas.

"When I approach prototyping, I like to treat it like \[doodle]."

Making a proper prototype will help you design a better game faster, but more importantly, it should be fun. If you aren't having fun making the prototype, it is better to just not do it at all.

## Application: Project Squad
I basically just said you can ignore everything I talked about in the first half of this video, but if you can implement prioritizing risky elements and failing fast, it really does work. When working on my personal game, I made more progress with my three week prototype than the past two years I had been in development without one. I started by implementing multiplayer because it is was the riskiest element, and I failed. So, I quickly moved on and tried again using a different method, and I'm now at this point.

## Conclusion
If you take anything away from this video, remember these three points: Prioritize risky elements, don't be afraid to start a new prototype, and  don't worry about it too much.

Thank you to all of my subscribers, and if you do want to see how I tried implementing multiplayer, check out my last video. I'll see you in the next one.
