# Outline

## Main Idea - Showcase the Benefits of Prototyping

## Introduction / Dilemma
- Prototype is often an advice given by experience game developers
- But, what does it actually mean to prototype, and why is it so important? **Dilemma!**
## Background
- What is Project Squad
	- Team up with your friends in a multiplayer roguelike bullet hell.
- Emphasize how much prototyping helped
	- With this recent prototype it has allowed me to make more progress in 30 days than I ever made in a combined 4 years of work.
- Setups up importance for prototyping
	- "\[Creating prototypes] compounds in a way that can improve the satisfaction, productivity, and performance of almost anybody." - Mark Barrett, "Hitchhiker's Guide to Rapid Prototypes" GDC
## In Depth
- What is a prototype?
	- Your game if you had one day to make it but everyone who plays it is blind, deaf, and motion blind (No visuals, audio, or polish)
	- "Prototype early. I cannot stress this enough. Look for the biggest unknown and make it the first thing to test. Mitigate the risk. Cut corners wherever it’s possible." - Marcin Jóźwik "7 lessons from my 7 early games" gamedeveloper.com
- What should a prototype accomplish?
	- Prove that the game can be made
	- Reveal any hidden design flaws in the idea
	- Get something fully playable
- What not to do in a prototype?
	- Make art, sounds, or any polish
	- If it looks so bad that it makes the onion sitting on your desk cry, you've made it look to good
	- I reused sprites from earlier version of my game and otherwise used colored cubes.
	- I also had no animations
## Learnable Takeaways
- Keep It Stupid Simple, you will thank yourself later for it
- Prototype what has a high chance of failure
- If something doesn't work out, be ready to adjust and experiment
# Script Draft 1
### Intro
You should prototype is advice that many game developers often give, but what really is a prototype, and more importantly, why should you make one? 

> Title Screen

Prototyping is extremely useful because it allows you to make better games faster, emphasis on faster. I can attest to that because I'm working on a multiplayer rougelike, and prototyping has allowed me to make more progress in three weeks than I have had in the last four years.

"\[Creating prototypes] compounds in a way that can improve the satisfaction, productivity, and performance of almost anybody." - Mark Barrett, "Hitchhiker's Guide to Rapid Prototypes" GDC
### What is a prototype?
In essence, a prototype is your entire game boiled down into something that can be made in 3 days. By your game I don't mean the menus, art, or side mechanics, instead your prototype game is three main pillars of your idea, the three core concepts that will combine together to make your game your game. In my prototype, I implemented multiplayer, shooting, and generated rooms and left out everything else.
### What should the prototype accomplish?
This is so important because it quickly accomplishes two things:
1. Grounding the game idea
2. Exploring the implementation

Often, when coming up with a game idea, you think about the general experience you want the player to have. A prototype focusses you on the specifics of your idea that are often overlooked. This saves time in the future because it makes it less likely that you'll have to rethink a part of the idea for the game because you overlooked a small issue. This applies to both the design and the technical implementation.

For example, when writing my prototype I ran into an issue with multiplayer physics which required me to change a majority of my code, but since prototype is quick, there wasn't actually that much code to change, saving time and energy.

You can think of a prototype as your game if you had three days to make it and the only person playing is deaf and blind. That means you do things quick, and you don't care about art, sound, or polish.

When making my prototype, I actually just reused old sprites, and even though I was tempted to animate them, I knew it would be a waste of time.

"Prototype early. (...) Look for the biggest unknown and make it the first thing to test. Mitigate the risk. Cut corners wherever it’s possible." - Marcin Jóźwik "7 lessons from my 7 early games" gamedeveloper.com
### When is a prototype done?
We should also talk about when a prototype is considered done . This isn't necessarily when the game is fun, or completely functioning, or even has a full gameplay loop. A prototype is finished when you see the resemblance of what could be a real game. For me, that was when I was able to join with my friend and shoot at some enemies in an infinite stream of rooms. From that point I could clearly see how this could turn into a full game one day, and there is little as motivational as that.
### Takeaways
If you leave this video learning anything it should be these 3 takeaways:
1. Keep it Stupid Simple
	This will save you time in case you need to redo anything which almost certainty going to happen.
2. Only Prototype the Core Ideas 
	You want see if your game idea will even work, unless your game is solely focused on aesthetic, the art is not nearly as important as the game mechanics.
3. Prepare to Adapt
	Things are probably not going to go perfectly, so make sure to be ready to delete, restart, or undo. In other words "Kill your Darlings"
### Outro
This is the part of the video where I thank all of you, and especially my subscribers who you can see on the screen right now. Thank you for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

# Draft 1 Notes
- "I can attest to that sounds weird"
- Transition from four years to quote sound weird, potentially lose a lot of people here
- Change the "I mean" part of what is a prototype
- Elaborate a lot more on what is a prototype
- Need explanation between saving time and two key points of a prototype
- Explain more about the unnecessity of visuals and polish in a prototype
- Transition to when a prototype is finished is strange
- More commentary on how the game has progressed
- Explain more about each takeaway
- Move what is a prototype earlier

# Key Points:
- Implement both the most risky parts of you game idea
	- "Look for the biggest unknown and make it the first thing to test. Mitigate the risk." - https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/7-lessons-from-my-7-early-games
	- "You want to de-risk your game concept by experimenting with high risk ideas as early on in the process as possible." - https://gamedesignskills.com/game-design/video-game-prototype/
	- I implemented the multiplayer first since it was the riskiest most up in the air aspect of the game
- Prioritize mechanics over visuals
	- "We found that game players are smarter than you think, and they can tell when you're pulling a fast one on them. If the gameplay is horrible, there is no recovery - all the art, music, and product tie-ins in the world won't make it a great game. Like taking a stale gameplay mechanic and slapping the latest 3D animated movie characters on it, nobody will be fooled." - https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/how-to-prototype-a-game-in-under-7-days
	- "Focus on only building what you need to create problems for the player and solve those problems. One or two cool mechanics that aren’t fully thought out are fine. However, they will lean very heavily on polish if the game content doesn’t support them" - https://gamedesignskills.com/game-design/video-game-prototype/#game-prototyping-tips
	- When prototyping the game I didn't create a single animation, sound effect, or sprite. I used only squares or old sprites I already had.
	- "Cut corners wherever it’s possible." - https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/7-lessons-from-my-7-early-games
# Draft 2
Your game will fail, if you do not prototype right is a sentiment that many experienced developers agree with.

"The ambitious projects I had undertaken in the past *failed* because I made the mistake of not proving out the core ideas in prototypes." - Chris Hecker, Developer of Spore

Prototypes are very important to the success of your game, so how do you prototype right?

The first thing that many developers get wrong is that they don't *implement the most risky part first.*

Video games are generally made up of a few core ideas. These ideas might not be individually unique but when combined, define the unique character of the video game. For example, Minecraft could be described as having three core ideas: "world of blocks", "sandbox", and "survival". A good prototype is one that takes the riskiest of these pillars and focuses on implementing and exploring that one.

"You want to de-risk your game concept by experimenting with high risk ideas as early on in the process as possible." - Alexander Brazie https://gamedesignskills.com/game-design/video-game-prototype/

By prioritizing the risky ideas you save time by encountering flaws with these core concepts early on. You definitely don't want to realize that a large part of your game has an issue after you have done a lot of work focused around that idea.

For example, when working on the prototype for my video game code named Project Squad, I came up with these three core pillars: multiplayer, teamwork, rougelike. Out of these three concepts, I decided that multiplayer is the most riskiest. After doing some work with a technique called Rollback, I discovered a major flaw with physics. I ended up completely shifting gears to use a different technique called Entity Interpolation which completely changed how the project code was architected, but since I hadn't gone too deep into working on any other part of the prototype nothing but work on the rollback was lost, saving a lot of time.

This begs the question: how do you identify what the riskiest concept is. Often the riskiest concept is the core mechanic which the player is going to spend most of their time interacting with like the movement in Super Mario. However, the concept can be a big technical challenge, like multiplayer in the case of Project Squad. Generally the riskiest concept of the game is not the theme or visual aesthetic but it is still a possibility even if it is less common.

Another thing that I struggle with, and so do a lot of other developers, is not ignoring any temptation to polish your prototype.

"Focus on only building what you need." "One or two cool mechanics that aren’t fully thought out are fine. However, they will lean very heavily on polish if the game content doesn’t support them" - Alexander Brazie https://gamedesignskills.com/game-design/video-game-prototype/#game-prototyping-tips

There are two pretty general ways to make a video game interesting: Mechanics to expose the player to interesting scenarios, and polish to make using those mechanics entertaining. A good prototype will focus on the mechanic and leave polish out. You want to be able to accurately assess the fun of the mechanics in your prototype, which polish can sometimes obscure. For example, you could make a fun game about just pressing a button by making it super polished, but instead if you had picked a more interesting mechanic to start and then polished, you would end up with a more fun game.

"If the gameplay is horrible, there is no recovery - all the art, music, and product tie-ins in the world won't make it a great game." - Matt Kucic https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/how-to-prototype-a-game-in-under-7-days

When working on my prototype for Project Squad, I didn't create a single sprite, sound effect, or animation. Everything was as bare bones as possible, either using just a square, or an old sprite.

Granted, there are some developers who say that they prefer polishing as they develop the mechanics because it gives them motivation, which is totally acceptable, but it does make it harder to separate the fun of the mechanic from the fun of the polish.

I want you to finish watching this video with two key takeaways.

First, you should prototype the riskiest part of your game. This will save you time early on so that you face less surprises later in development.

Second, resist as much as you can to polish. The game might look like horrendous, but it will allow the fun or lack of fun of the mechanics to clearly shine through.

Thank you so much for watching, and thank you to my subscribers who you can see here on screen. If you would like to learn more about Project Squad or just chat with me, join my discord, link in the description. I'll see you in the next one.
