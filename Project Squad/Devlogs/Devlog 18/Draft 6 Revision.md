# A Great Prototype Is The Key to a Successful Game!
A great prototype is the key to a successful game. Because here's the thing, professional developers have refined three techniques that you need know to make sure your game succeeds. So what makes a great prototype?
# What is a Great Prototype?
Simplify to the Core Element is the first technique used by Alex Beachum, one of the two designers of Outer Wilds. When creating the prototype for Outer Wilds, Alex Beachum constructed it purely with paper. While this may seem strange, it's perfect because the prototype does exactly what it needs to do: test the narrative. 

"\[The paper prototype] completely abstracted away the space travel and focused on what we wanted to test: the underlying narrative structure. " - Alex Beachum

Technique one states that the key to a great prototype is to simplify the prototype down to its core element, or the risky idea that defines the unique part of the game. Successful games are born out of these types of prototypes because the prototypes explore and refine the core of the game quickly.

"We needed a way for players to test the game's entire narrative structure in a fraction of the time it would take during a normal playthrough." - Alex Beachum

Once the narrative was more finalized, the Outer Wilds teamed moved on to digital based prototypes, but only after proving out the core mechanic. Outer Wilds owes it's three awards: Best Game, Best Game Design, and Best Narrative to this technique. However to use this technique properly, you need to understand the secret weapon of these two developers. *Chaim Gingold and Chris Hecker*
# How do you focus on a Core Element?
In their GDC talk on advanced prototyping, Chaim Gingold and Chris Hecker share that the key to a great prototype is to ask a testable question.

"Good prototypes make some kind of claim. Once you have the prototype written you should be able to tell if it actually worked." - Chaim Gingold

Posing a testable question about a core element is the best way to prototype that idea. This second technique helps you clearly verify if a core element is working. An effective question will have a clear cut yes or no answer. That way it is obvious to determine the prototype's failure or success. An effective question will also be clearly testable. It's much harder to test if controls feel "fun" than test if a jump is responsive. As an exercise: try asking a question that will test this core idea: platforming but you can't jump. I would ask: "Can a falling character feel responsive to control?" According to a developer of Spore, coming up with good testable questions is critical to creating a successful game.

"The ambitious projects I had undertaken in the past failed because I made the mistake of not proving out the core ideas in prototypes." - Chris Hecker
# To help you come up with ideas to test, Make Doodles!
While it can be difficult to come up with good testable questions, technique three can help you out. One way to come up with ideas to test is to make little informal experiments like Derek Yu, the developer of Spelunky.

"When I approach prototyping, I like to treat it like \[doodle]." - Derek Yu

By experimenting without a defined direction at first you open yourself to creative ideas that you can refine using the previous two techniques. These "doodles" can take different forms from small sketches, to little unnamed projects in your game engine of choice, but they all act to get you thinking and give you material to build off of. You want to be inspired, especially because motivation and curiosity will drive you to make a lot of progress while having fun.

# To help you apply this, let's look at my Experience
These three techniques will help your game succeed, so it's critical that you understand them. In fact, in implementing these techniques myself, I've been much more productive in the development of my own game. When developing the prototype for my game I needed to test the core idea of multiplayer combat. So I asked the testable question: "Can Network Rollback code feel responsive in combat." And the answer was a clear no because of issues relating to physics. So I tested a second idea: "Can Entity Interpolation code feel responsive in combat." I found that indeed it was responsive. Having discovered this paved a clear road of progress and dramatically increased my motivation to work on the game to its current state in alpha.
# Review and Outro
These three techniques we've talked about has led me to today with a promising game, and three key take aways for you:
1. Simplify to the Core Element
2. Ask testable questions
3. Doodle
