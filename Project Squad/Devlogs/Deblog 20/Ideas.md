## Story Structure
Interesting opening -> Build to conflict -> Resolve conflict -> Build to result -> Final result

## Audience
The audience should be game developers, but packaged in a way that it is easier for beginners to follow.
### What does this mean?
The video will need to be constructed in a story format, focusing on myself, not the tech. I can use the technical issues as conflicts for the story, and also use the resolution of the conflicts to give insight into the development.
