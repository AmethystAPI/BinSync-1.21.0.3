## Notes
Prototypes are about the interaction
Prototype = Minimum Viable Interaction
Prototype helps figure out your core mechanic
You must realistically represent your vision
Explore the the technical possibility of your game

### Introduction Dilemma
- Introduces a dilemma
- Briefly explains how the dilemma was resolved
- Finally connects relevance of the dilemma to the video with a quote from a valve employee
- This essentially provides the context for the video and explains why the topic is important
### Background Information
- Defines what playtesting is as well as elaborates on how valve did the playtesting
- Backs up explanation with a concrete example
- **I notice GMTK like to back up explanations of concepts with an example, then commentate.**
- More is also done here to elaborate on the subject of the video's importance
### Moving More In Depth
- This is where Mark goes in to how Valve specifically does their playtesting (the apparent main point of the video)
- Mark extensively uses quotes to backup the information he provides
### Narrative Moment
- In this section Mark starts talking about how valve's playtesting devloped
- I think this develops the significance of the video's content
### Learnable Information
- This is where the actual takeaways are located
- Actionable information is given to the viewer
- This is by far the largest section of the video.
- I would also argue that this is the most important section, everything is leading up to either providing context or backing
## Designing Difficulty

# Outline

## Main Idea - Showcase the Benefits of Prototyping

## Introduction / Dilemma
- Prototype is often an advice given by experience game developers
- But, what does it actually mean to prototype, and why is it so important? **Dilemma!**
## Background
- What is Project Squad
	- Team up with your friends in a multiplayer roguelike bullet hell.
- Emphasize how much prototyping helped
	- With this recent prototype it has allowed me to make more progress in 30 days than I ever made in a combined 4 years of work.
- Setups up importance for prototyping
	- "\[Creating prototypes] compounds in a way that can improve the satisfaction, productivity, and performance of almost anybody." - Mark Barrett, "Hitchhiker's Guide to Rapid Prototypes" GDC
## In Depth
- What is a prototype?
	- Your game if you had one day to make it but everyone who plays it is blind, deaf, and motion blind (No visuals, audio, or polish)
	- "Prototype early. I cannot stress this enough. Look for the biggest unknown and make it the first thing to test. Mitigate the risk. Cut corners wherever it’s possible." - Marcin Jóźwik "7 lessons from my 7 early games" gamedeveloper.com
- What should a prototype accomplish?
	- Prove that the game can be made
	- Reveal any hidden design flaws in the idea
	- Get something fully playable
- What not to do in a prototype?
	- Make art, sounds, or any polish
	- If it looks so bad that it makes the onion sitting on your desk cry, you've made it look to good
	- I reused sprites from earlier version of my game and otherwise used colored cubes.
	- I also had no animations
## Learnable Takeaways
- Keep It Stupid Simple, you will thank yourself later for it
- Prototype what has a high chance of failure
- If something doesn't work out, be ready to adjust and experiment
# Script Draft 1
### Intro
You should prototype is advice that many game developers often give, but what really is a prototype, and more importantly, why should you make one? 

> Title Screen

Prototyping is extremely useful because it allows you to make better games faster, emphasis on faster. I can attest to that because I'm working on a multiplayer rougelike, and prototyping has allowed me to make more progress in three weeks than I have had in the last four years.

"\[Creating prototypes] compounds in a way that can improve the satisfaction, productivity, and performance of almost anybody." - Mark Barrett, "Hitchhiker's Guide to Rapid Prototypes" GDC
### What is a prototype?
In essence, a prototype is your entire game boiled down into something that can be made in 3 days. By your game I don't mean the menus, art, or side mechanics, instead your prototype game is three main pillars of your idea, the three core concepts that will combine together to make your game your game. In my prototype, I implemented multiplayer, shooting, and generated rooms and left out everything else.
### What should the prototype accomplish?
This is so important because it quickly accomplishes two things:
1. Grounding the game idea
2. Exploring the implementation

Often, when coming up with a game idea, you think about the general experience you want the player to have. A prototype focusses you on the specifics of your idea that are often overlooked. This saves time in the future because it makes it less likely that you'll have to rethink a part of the idea for the game because you overlooked a small issue. This applies to both the design and the technical implementation.

For example, when writing my prototype I ran into an issue with multiplayer physics which required me to change a majority of my code, but since prototype is quick, there wasn't actually that much code to change, saving time and energy.

You can think of a prototype as your game if you had three days to make it and the only person playing is deaf and blind. That means you do things quick, and you don't care about art, sound, or polish.

When making my prototype, I actually just reused old sprites, and even though I was tempted to animate them, I knew it would be a waste of time.

"Prototype early. (...) Look for the biggest unknown and make it the first thing to test. Mitigate the risk. Cut corners wherever it’s possible." - Marcin Jóźwik "7 lessons from my 7 early games" gamedeveloper.com
### When is a prototype done?
We should also talk about when a prototype is considered done . This isn't necessarily when the game is fun, or completely functioning, or even has a full gameplay loop. A prototype is finished when you see the resemblance of what could be a real game. For me, that was when I was able to join with my friend and shoot at some enemies in an infinite stream of rooms. From that point I could clearly see how this could turn into a full game one day, and there is little as motivational as that.
### Takeaways
If you leave this video learning anything it should be these 3 takeaways:
1. Keep it Stupid Simple
	This will save you time in case you need to redo anything which almost certainty going to happen.
2. Only Prototype the Core Ideas 
	You want see if your game idea will even work, unless your game is solely focused on aesthetic, the art is not nearly as important as the game mechanics.
3. Prepare to Adapt
	Things are probably not going to go perfectly, so make sure to be ready to delete, restart, or undo. In other words "Kill your Darlings"
### Outro
This is the part of the video where I thank all of you, and especially my subscribers who you can see on the screen right now. Thank you for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

# Draft 1 Notes
- "I can attest to that sounds weird"
- Transition from four years to quote sound weird, potentially lose a lot of people here
- Change the "I mean" part of what is a prototype
- Elaborate a lot more on what is a prototype
- Need explanation between saving time and two key points of a prototype
- Explain more about the unnecessity of visuals and polish in a prototype
- Transition to when a prototype is finished is strange
- More commentary on how the game has progressed
- Explain more about each takeaway
- Move what is a prototype earlier
