Items with simple but synergizing effects.
## Rules
### No Single Player Only Trinkets
All trinkets should in some way become more powerful with more players. This rules out simple damage or health buffs. Instead we can have trinkets that give weakness to enemies or protects all nearby allies from on hit damage.
## Goals
- Allow Playstyle Expression
- Synergize
- Promote Cooperation
## Ideas

### Holy / Faith Trinket

## Obtaining
Trinkets will be given out every few levels to all players. You'll be offered one trinket and can take or leave. Trinkets will not be shareable between players. This if for two reasons:
1. Players can not be forced into trades that they don't think are fun in order to have a better build for others
2. Players will be forced to adjust their play style

The background will fade to a black screen or ethereal realm except for player and trinkets This is where the players can take or leave. the trinket. Once taken, the realm will fade away.
