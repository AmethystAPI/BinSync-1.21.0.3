Items with powerful synergizing effects.
## Rules
### No Single Player Only Trinkets
All trinkets should in some way become more powerful with more players. This rules out simple damage or health buffs. Instead we can have trinkets that give weakness to enemies or protects all nearby allies from on hit damage.

### No Harmful Trinkets
Trinkets are automatically given to the player so no trinket should make a build worse. For trinkets with trade offs, I should look into "Corrupted" Trinkets.
## Goals
- Synergize
- Promote Cooperation
- Shake Up Gameplay
