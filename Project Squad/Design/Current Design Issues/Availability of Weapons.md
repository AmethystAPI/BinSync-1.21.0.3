## The Issue
The game seems to be lacking in potential variety and replay ability. All players start with a sword, leading to gameplay the feels similar between people and runs.
## Potential Solutions
### Regular Weapon Drops
Weapons could regularly drop from enemies, allowing players to pick up a new item.
Pros:
- Adds variability throughout the run
- Adds an extra incentive to combat
Cons:
- Players will discover weapons extra fast, reducing discovery and gameplay time
### Randomized Start Weapons
Players could each begin with a random weapon from a selection.
Pros:
- Adds variability to each run
Cons:
- May make players stuck with weapons they do not enjoy
### Challenging Rooms Drop Reward
Challenging rooms such as boss rooms provide a new weapon as a reward.
Pros:
- Adds rewards to difficult rooms
Cons:
- Challenging rooms are not very common and reduce the ability of this idea to add variance during the runs.
