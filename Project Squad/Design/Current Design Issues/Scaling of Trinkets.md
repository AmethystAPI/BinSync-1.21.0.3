## The Issue
Trinkets are provided too commonly and give way to builds that feel overpowered and remove challenge.
## Potential Solutions
### Reduce Power of Trinkets
Make trinkets less powerful to combat the broken scaling.
Pros:
- Simple
Cons:
- Reduces reward felt when receiving a trinket
- Doesn't address issue of having too many trinkets taking up visual space
### Reset Trinkets Occasionally
At specific landmarks in the game, force the player to get rid of all trinkets.
Pros:
- Adds variability to the run
- Limits broken builds *(potentially a con)*
Cons:
- Resets player's work
### Scale Enemies
Make enemies more difficult and able to withstand more powerful builds.
Pros:
- Can work with other solutions
Cons:
- Doesn't address issue of having too many trinkets taking up visual space
### Make Trinkets Rarer
Make trinkets rarer. 1-2 per biome instead of 3-4.
Pros:
- Allows trinkets to still have meaningful and powerful effects
- Addresses issue of having too many trinkets
Cons:
- Requires balancing to make sure player's are still getting rewarded
