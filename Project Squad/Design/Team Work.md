Team work is the **CORE IDEA** of Project Squad. All mechanics should be contributing to this idea.
## Incentivization
In order to get players engaging in team work, we need to incentivize it as much as possible.
### Room Size
Room's are small enough to force player's to fight in relatively close quarters. This forces players to at least fight together even if they are not utilizing synergy mechanics.
### Dificulty
Difficulty scales logarithmically with the amount of players, so playing with more players, while adjusts balance, makes it easier overall.
### Trinkets
[[Trinkets]] are powerups. The more you have, the more powerful your squad. Having more players, means that you can hold more trinkets, further increasing the power of your squad. Trinkets should be able to function in singleplayer, but are more effective or powerful when interacting with other players.
