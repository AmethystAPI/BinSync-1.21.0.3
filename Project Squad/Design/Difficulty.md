# Change
Difficulty is a value that increases per room completed based on the amount of players playing.

The difficulty increase for singleplayer and two player is the same, however after that it increases with a logarithmic or similar falloff. That way playing with more players is easier but not my too much, except in the case of single player which is harder than two player to incentivize cooperation.
# Enemies
Difficulty affects the amount and type of enemies within a room. Enemies are given point values and rooms will spend points up to the current difficulty.
# Loot
Different loot is locked behind different thresholds of difficulty, that way higher tiered loot will be found later in the run.
