# Rooms
The goal here is to have 5 uniquely laid out room variations for the alpha.
## Weapons
The goal is to have 4 unique [[Weapons]].
1. Bow
2. Sword
3. Hammer
4. Spear
## Trinkets
I want 6 unique [[Trinkets]]. The reason I want so many is to explore the idea of cooperation and trinkets being such a big part of the game.
## Enemies
I want 4 unique [[Enemies]].
## Visuals
The alpha should have visuals that while, not polished, are still acting to enhance the gameplay through visual language. This means simple attack animations for telegraphing, player attacking, and damage.

Everything will also be getting a very rough initial pass at art. The alpha is going to purely take place within the [[Golden Grove]]
