# Goal
Polish up combat with visual indicators and reduce difficulty.

# Progress
I've balanced the crow since they added quite the challenge especially with a bunch of them.

The sword, hammer, bow, and spear also received some polish to experiment with what weapons might look like.

The main menu was also improved in preparation for a public release.

# Playtest Notes
- Monotonous, more room variation
- Potential procedural decorations in rooms
- Indicators to damage
- Hammer difficult to use
