# Goal
Improve game feel and work on trinkets.
# Progress
World generator now uses room placers which hold extra information about how rooms will be placed. This allows rooms to only have certain connections. I'm going to make the ability for rooms  to have multiple exit directions not the default behavior since it makes nice looking rooms so much harder.

The slime art was also worked on.
