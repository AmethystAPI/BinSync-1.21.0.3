[Previous Day](Daily%20Notes/Day%2018-8)

Today's goal is to add weapons and work on at least adding in a fully functional slime and large slime.

I've updated the sword, bow, and hammer as well as adding in the spear item. I've also added in the slime enemy. I decided to not add the large slime and baby slime into the alpha since the goal of the alpha is to test mechanics not add content.

The alpha plan is actually technically finished today. I added in the crow and stone golem.

After playtesting I noticed a few things:
- Combat feels jank because there is little visual feedback
- The game is too difficult
