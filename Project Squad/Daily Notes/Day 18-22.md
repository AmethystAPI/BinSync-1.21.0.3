The world generator has been changed a lot to support placing more than one room at a time, just in case that helps with something later.

The barrier between rooms has received a visual upgrade which took a LOT of work. ~2-3 hours.

Destructible bushes were added which looks amazing but also took way too long.
# Playtest Notes
It was really fun, which is really good! One player was not able to move, might be a network issue on their end. Ran into the old white glitch. Also chests weren't spawning. Doge raised some points about how we'll transition to biomes and how the trinkets will stack. I think the their will be transition rooms between biomes and trinkets will be "cleansed" each biome.
